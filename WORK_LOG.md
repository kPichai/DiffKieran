| Feb 24 | 10:45am - 11:55am | I discussed with Isha and Tony who came up with using a making change approach in which you have your "axis" represent the individual chars in each of the two doc strings. You can then create subproblems where you match individual chars to chars and slowly build the project up over time. The cell in the bottom right would be your solutionâ€”this a tabulation approach to this problem set. |

One issue I had was an out of bounds error but then I realized all I had to change was do i-1 and j-1 on line 22. |
